# Markdown For Typora

## Overview

**Markdown** is created by [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/), the original guideline is [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Its syntax, however, varies between different parsers or editors. **Typora** is using [GitHub Flavored Markdown][GFM].

[GFM]: https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/

 Please note that HTML fragments in markdown source will be recognized but not parsed or rendered. Also, there may be small reformatting on the original markdown source code after saving.

[TOC]

## Block Elements

### Paragraph and line breaks

A paragraph is simply one ore more consecutive lines of text. In markdown source code, paragraphs are separated by more than one blank lines. In Typora, you only need to press `Return` to create a new paragraph.

Press `Shoft` + `Return` to create a single line break. However, most markdown parser will ignore single line break, to make other markdown parsers recongnize you line break, you can leave two whitespace at the end of the ling, or insert `<br/>`.

### HEADERS

Headers use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line, corresponding to header levels 1-6. For Example:

```markdown
# This is an H1

## This is an H2

###### This is an H6
```

In Typora, input '#'s followed by title content, and press `Return` key will create a header.

### Blockquotes

Markdown uses email-style > characters for block quoting. They are presented as:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote with two paragraphs. This is forst paragraph.
> 
> This is second pragraph. Vestibulum enim wisi, viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.



> This is another blockquote with one paragraph. There is three empty line to seperate two blockquote.
```

In typo, just input '>' followed by quote contents a block quote is generated. Typo will insert proper '>' or line break for you. Block quote inside another block quote is allowed by adding additional levels of '>'.

> test quote.
>
> > small quote



> this is another quote

### Lists

Input `* list item 1` will create an un-ordered list, the `*` symbol can be replace with `+` or `-`.

Input `1. list item 1` will create an ordered list, their markdown source code is like:

* Red
* Green
* Blue

1. Red
2. Green
3. Blue

### Task List

  中文缩进

Task lists are lists with items marked as either [ ] or [x] (incomplete or  complete). For example:

- [ ] a task list item
- [ ] list syntax required
- [x] completed

You can change the complete/incomplete state by click the checkbox before the item.



```markdown
- [ ] a task list item
- [x] complete
```

### (Fenced) Code blocks

Typora only support fences in Github Flavored Markdown. Original code blocks in markdown is not supported.

Using fences is easy: input \`\`\` and press `return`. Add an optional language identifier after \`\`\` and we'll run it through syntax highlightting:

```
function test(){
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new('Hello World!')
puts markdown.to_html
```

### Math Blocks

You can render *LaTex* mathematical expressions using **MathJax**.

Input `$$`, then press `Return` key will trigger an input field which accept *Tex/LaTex* source. Following is an example:
$$
\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} & \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v}&0\\
\end{vmatrix}
$$

可以采用如下方式引用公式，并编号，例如公式$\eqref{test}$表明...
$$
y = e^x
\tag{1}
\label{test}
$$




### Tables

Input `| First Header | Second Header |` and `Return` key will vreate a table with two column.

After table is created, focus on that table will pop up a toolbar for table, where you can resize, align, or delete table. you can aslo use context menu to copy and add/delete column/row.[测试跳转](#test)

Following descriptions can be skipped, as markdown source code for tables are generated by typora automatically.

> 可使用以下HTML语法来添加表格标题

<div align=center>测试表格标题</div>

| Left-Aligned | Center Aligned  | Right Aligned |
| :----------- | :-------------: | ------------: |
| col 3 is     | some wordy text |         $1600 |
| col 2 is     |    centered     |           $12 |
| zebra strips |    are neat     |            $1 |

### Footnotes

You can create footnotes like this[^footnote]

[^footnote]: Here is the *text* of the **footnote**.

Mouse on the 'footnote' superscript to see content of the footnote.

### Horizontal Rules

Input `***` or `---`  on a blank line and press `return` will draw a horizontal line.

----

### YAML Front Matters

Typora support [YAML Front Matters](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) now. Input `---` at the top of the article and then press `enter` will introduce one. Or insert one metadata block from menu. [图1](#img1)显示...

### Table of Contents (TOC)

Input `[toc]` then press `return` key will create a section for "Table of Contents" extracting all headers from one's writing, its contents will be updated automatically.

## Span Elements

Span elements will be parsed and rendered right after your typing. Moving cursor in middle of those span elements will expand those elements into markdown source. Following will explain the syntax of these span element.

### Links

Markdown supports two style of links: inline and reference.

In both styles, the link text is delimited by [square brackets].

To create an inline link, use a set of regular parentheses immediately after the link text's closing square bracket. Inside the parentheses, put the URL where you want the link to point, along with an optional title for the link, surrounded in quotes. For example:

This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.

```markdown
This is [an example][id] reference-style link.
```



[This link](http://example.net/) has no title attribute.

**You can set the href to headers**, which will create a bookmark that allow you to jump to that section after clicking. For example:

Command + Click [This link](#Overview) will jump to header `Overview`.

Reference-style links use a second set of square brackets, inside which you place a label of your choosing to identify the link:

This is [an example][id] reference-style link.

[id]: http://example.com/

The implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link, in which case the link text itself is used as the name. Just use an empty set of square brackets — e.g., to link the word "google" to the google.com website.

you could simply write:

[Google][]

[Google]: http://google.com/

### URLs

Typo allows yout to insert urls as links, wrapped by `<`bracjets`>`.

`<i@typora.io>` becomes <i@typora.io>.

Typo will aslo auto link standard URLs. e.g: www.google.com.

### Images

Image looks similar with links, but it requires an additional `!` char before the start of link. Images syntax looks like this:

```markdown
![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg)

![Alt text](/path/to/img.jpg "optional title")
```
<span id = 'img1'></span>
 ![insert first pic](Dropbox/PHD/工作总结/2014下/qms.png 'QMS示意图')





You are able to use drag & drop to insert image from image file or webbrowser. And modify the markdown source code by clicking on the image. Relative path will be used if image is in same directory or sub-directory with current editing document when drag & drop.

![drag and drop image](http://typora.io/img/drag-img.gif)



test html style:

> 插入图片可以用以下HTML语法，可改变图片大小、位置和标题

<div align=center>

<img src="http://ww2.sinaimg.cn/bmiddle/88070423gw1ep30aw8an7g204d04gkgd.gif" width="200" height="200" alt="亦菲表演机器猫" title="测试标题"/>

<div>亦菲表演机器猫</div>

</div>



<div align=center>

<img src="qms.png" height='200'/>

<div>QMS示意图</div>

</div>



### Emphasis

Markdown treats asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) as indicators of emphasis. Text wrapped with one `*` or `_` will be wrapped with an HTML `<em>` tag. E.g.:

*single asterisks*

_single underscores_

*测试中文斜体*

GFM will ignores underscores in words, which is commonly used in code and names, like this:

> wow_great_stuff
>
> do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing.

wow_great_stuff

To produce a literal asterisk or underscore at a position where it would otherwise be used as an emphasis delimiter, you can backslash escape it:

```markdown
\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*
```

\*this text is surrounded by literal asterisks\*

Typora recommends to use `*` symbol.

### Strong

Double *'s or _'s will be wrapped with HTML `<strong>` tag, e.g:

**double asterisks**

__double underscores__

**中文强调**

Typo recommends to use `**` symbol.

### Code

To indicate a span of code, wrap it with backtick quotes (`). Unlike a pre-formatted code block, a code span indicates code within a normal paragraph . For example:

Use the `printf()` function.

### Strikethrough

GFM adds syntax to create strikethrough text, which is missing from standard Markdown.

`~~Mistaken text.~~` becomes ~~Mistaken text.~~

### Underline

Underline is powered by raw HTML.

`<u>Underline</u>` becomes <u>Underline</u>.

### Emoji :happy:

Input emoji with syntax `:smile:`.

### Inline Math

Use `$your math$` to trigger it.



$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{X_i}} $

$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{{({X_i} - \bar X)}^2}} $, 

$\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{X_i}} $

$$
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{X_i}{Y_i}}
$$
$$
\sum\limits_{i = 1}^n {{X_i}{Y_i}}
$$

My first equation is using *LaTeX* to write $y = e^{x^2}$.
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{2n}\\

\lim_{x \to 3}x^2
$$
$\lim\limits_{x \to 1}$,  $\sum_{i=1}^{2n}$, is it to large? $\lim\limits_{x \to 3}x^2$,



![inline-math](http://typora.io/img/inline-math.gif)

### Subscript

To use `~` to wrap subscript content, for example: `H~2~O`, `X~long\ text~`.

H~2~O is different with $H_{2}O$.

X~long\ text~ needs `\ ` to translate `space` button.

### Superscript

To use `^` to wrap superscript content, for example: `x^2^`.

x^2^ is aslo different with $x^2$.

### Highlight

To use `==` to wrap highlight content, for example: `==highlight==`.

Test the ==highlight==.
